                  There are two species of gorilla, each containing two
                  subspecies. The two species are eastern and western, and the
                  four sub-species are

                  <span class="colored-text">Western</span> Lowland (are
                  sub-species of the Western species) and Grauer’s and Mountain
                  (are sub-species of the Eastern species). Western gorillas can
                  be distinguished from other gorilla
                  <span class="colored-text">subspecies</span> by their
                  brownish-gray hair, auburn-colored crests and overall smaller
                  size. Eastern gorillas tend to be black in color and larger in
                  size. In all gorillas, males develop silver coloration along
                  their backs as they mature. The species is diurnal, which
                  means they are active during the day, and of all the great
                  apes, gorillas are the most terrestrial. This means that they
                  primarily live on the ground, although they do
                  <span class="colored-text">occasionally climb trees</span> to
                  feed and nest. They are also able to stand on two legs for
                  short periods of time.

                  Physical features and characteristics:

                <p>
                  Gorillas are the largest of all primates and reach physical
                  maturity between 12 and 15 years of age. Males can be between
                  350 and 450 pounds, almost twice as much as females, weighing
                  in between <span class="colored-text">150</span> and
                  <span class="colored-text">250</span> pounds. Males stand
                  between 5.5 to 6 feet tall. Females are a bit smaller,
                  standing between 4’7” to 4’11”. The males’ heads are large and
                  pointed due to the sagittal crest that forms the back of the
                  top of the head. This crest serves as the foundation for
                  attachment of a great number of jaw muscle fibers, which
                  allows for the chewing power needed to process tough
                  vegetation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The vision and perception of western lowland gorillas is
                  similar to that of humans. Gorillas have a prominent brow
                  ridge, small, flat ears, and hear about the same as humans.
                  The nose is broad, flat and fleshy. The wrinkles on a
                  gorilla’s nose, known as a noseprint, are like human
                  fingerprints, and every individual’s noseprint is unique.
                  Researchers use these noseprints as identification markers in
                  their studies, both in zoological settings and in the wild.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gorillas have 32 teeth, including sharp canines used for
                  defense and breaking through vegetation. Their molars have
                  complicated patterns of cups and ridges that facilitate
                  chewing of tough plant fibers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gorillas’ faces, hands, and feet are bare, but the rest of
                  their bodies are covered with short, thin hair. Gorilla hands
                  and feet are large, with leathery palms and soles, and broad,
                  flat nails Their hands are very dexterous and can pick up
                  small, delicate objects. Like their hands, their feet have
                  opposable thumbs and toes. Like all apes, gorillas’ arms are
                  longer than their legs—a feature that allows them to walk on
                  all fours. They are called “knuckle-walkers,” meaning that
                  they walk on the knuckles of their forelimbs and the soles of
                  their hind limbs. This form of locomotion develops calluses on
                  the knuckles, preserving the sensitivity of the fingertips
                  necessary for
                  <span class="colored-text">manipulating</span> smaller

                  Gorillas tend to be shy, peaceful creatures; they are not
                  normally aggressive to other animals unless provoked. However,
                  if they are provoked, they can be dangerous. They can
                  demonstrate aggression by charging towards perceived
                  intruders. Typically, they will not actually hit the intruder,
                  but rush past, turn and then charge again.

                <p class="before-ul">
                  Gorillas use a combination of vocalizations, visual signals
                  and scents to communicate. They are considered relatively
                  quiet compared to other primates, but do have at least
                  <span class="colored-text">25 recognized</span>
                  vocalizations, including:
                </p>

                  <li>
                    Hooting: Can carry for a mile through the forest and is
                    usually accompanied by display behavior such as chest
                    beating, strutting, and vegetation slapping
                  </li>
                  <li>Screams: Sounds of alarm or warning</li>
                  <li>
                    Belches: Deep rumblings of contentment, comfort, or

                  Infants have three distinct vocalizations; these are similar
                  to the cries of a human baby. They will typically cry when
                  hurt or frightened, resulting in an immediate response from
                  the mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dominant males also have a distinctive smell that they use to
                  communicate with other troops and to maintain contact with
                  their own troop. Perhaps the most recognizable behavior
                  performed by gorillas is chest-beating. It is primarily done
                  by male gorillas at the end of a display meant to intimidate
                  intruding males or predators. The sound can be heard for long
                  distances. Females will chest-beat infrequently; they will
                  typically beat their hands against the insides of their
                  thighs. Chest-beating can also indicate playful behavior,
                  however, especially in the young. Young gorillas play much
                  like humans do, playing tag and doing somersaults.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Western lowland gorillas live in family groups known as
                  troops. These troops can consist of 5 to 30 individuals,
                  although the average size is 11. The group is led by a
                  dominant silverback male and contains several adult females
                  and their young. The females will typically bond with the
                  silverback, but not necessarily with each other. The
                  silverback will remain dominant for as long as he can defeat
                  competing males.
                </p>

                  There are several younger, blackback males that remain in the
                  group until they are capable of challenging the silverback.
                  These young males are often driven out of the troop to live a
                  solitary life or to live in a smaller group with other
                  bachelors until they establish their own troops. If a dominant
                  silverback is displaced, the new dominant male will typically
                  kill the infants in the troop, sending the females prematurely
                  into reproductive cycling. This increases the male’s chances
                  of siring offspring, as his time as the dominant male is
                  uncertain. As such, females consider a male’s ability to fight
                  paramount to their offspring’s survival.

                <p>
                  On maturing, females will also leave their natal group to join
                  a lone male or another small group. This is vital to prevent
                  inbreeding and to protect the gene pool.

                  Nesting typically occurs in the late afternoon, with the
                  gorillas bedding down for the night at sundown. The females
                  and their offspring will build nests of leaves and branches,
                  while the dominant silverback will settle at the base of the
                  tree, in order to protect his family. At Zoo Atlanta, while
                  the gorillas are outside, their indoor areas are thoroughly
                  cleaned; the walls and floors are scrubbed with
                  <span class="colored-text">disinfectant</span>disinfectant.
                  The gorillas are offered hay in their indoor area at night and
                  nest with this material, replicating natural behavior.

                  In a troop, the single silverback male will mate with the
                  females, siring all the offspring of the troop. Females
                  generally reach reproductive maturity between 7 and 8 years of
                  age, with males reaching maturity later, around 10 years of
                  age, due to competition. The potential breeding season is
                  year-round and gestation typically takes 256 days, or about
                  8.5 months. Labor can last anywhere from one to 4 hours.
                  Babies are usually born singly; twins are rare. Newborns weigh
                  between 3 and 5 pounds and are weaned around 2 to 3 years of
                  age, but can be dependent on their mothers for up to 4 years.
                  The average interval between births for a female gorilla is
                  four to six years.

                <p>
                  Western lowland gorillas prefer the tall, lush tropical forest
                  of west and central Africa. The herbs, shrubs and vines that
                  make up its diet grow best where the open canopy allows plenty
                  of light to reach the forest floor. These tropical forests
                  also contain a much higher diversity of arboreal substrates
                  and foods, in particular fruit, than mountainous habitats.
                  Western lowland gorillas live primarily on the ground and
                  build sleeping nests on the ground or in the trees for the
                  night.

                <div class="general-name subtitle">Diet:</div>
                <p>
                  Western lowland gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on
                  plant parts including seeds, leaves, stems, shoots, roots and
                  flowers; however, they prefer fruit whenever it’s in season.
                  Occasionally they will eat insects, such as termites or ants,
                  as a supplement to their diet when they are readily available.
                  Due to their dietary preferences, western lowland gorillas
                  spend a lot of their time in and around trees, especially
                  fruit trees. Even large males can sometimes be found up in the
                  trees, but they are careful to stay near a main trunk or on
                  larger branches that are able to support their weight.
                  Younger, lighter gorillas may climb higher in trees, even
                  swinging freely from branch to branch. Gorillas never
                  completely strip vegetation from a single area; rather, the
                  rapid regrowth of the vegetation they consume allows them to
                  stay within a reasonable confined home range for extended
                  periods of time.

                  Here at Zoo, we provide a medley of fruits and vegetables to
                  our western lowland gorillas. These include apples, oranges,
                  bananas, raisins, sweet potatoes, cabbage, collards, and
                  primate chow. In the morning, vegetables and fruit are chopped
                  up and
                  <span class="colored-text">scattered</span> around the
                  habitat. From there, the gorillas come outside and forage for
                  their food as they would in the wild. Browse foods including
                  bamboo, banana leaves, mulberry, elm and willow are also
                  scattered in their habitat.
